# Auto import components

By using the NPM package ["vite-plugin-components"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-components). You just copy the components you need to your components folder.
Thats all, no needs for import just use it, all is done by this brilliant package from Anthony Fu.



```
npm install vite-plugin-components # OR 
yarn add vite-plugin-components
```
